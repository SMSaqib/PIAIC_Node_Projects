This code will first prompt the user to enter the path to the file they want to extract. The code will then read the contents of the file and extract the file.

The specific steps involved in extracting the file will vary depending on the type of file. For example, to extract a ZIP file, you would use the following code:

TypeScript
import unzip from 'unzip';

async function extractZipFile(filePath: string): Promise<void> {
  const zip = await unzip.Unzip(filePath);

  // Extract the files from the ZIP file
  for (const file of zip.files) {
    const extractedFilePath = `${__dirname}/${file.name}`;

    // Write the extracted file to disk
    await fs.writeFileSync(extractedFilePath, file.buffer);
  }
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
You can replace the extractZipFile() function with a function that extracts the specific type of file that you want to extract.

Once you have extracted the file, you can then use it however you need.
